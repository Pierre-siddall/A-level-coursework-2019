# A-level-coursework-2019
This is the code for a tile-based game that I produced for my Computer Science A-level between September 2019 and April 2020.

The code I produced assumes that all the assets for the game are placed on your desktop. 
In later versions reading from an assests file would have been one of the improvements made.
The tile based map in my coursework was made with the tiled software, where I used tilesets
to bring the game to life. This code was mostly written with the help of KidsCanCode tile-based
game series on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UxnelT9aCo&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaGQq7ybM8Lgkh5EMxUWPm2i) 
as this was my first time using the pygame and pytmx modules in python. However I did write a couple of algorithms  
(such as the endgame and nextwave methods) in the code after I got the hang of using pygame and pytmx.
